# Bellwether

> **Test your MCP servers. Catch drift. Get documentation for free.**

## What is MCP?

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) is an open standard created by Anthropic for connecting AI assistants to external tools. When you hear "MCP server," think "a service that gives AI agents capabilities"—like reading files, querying databases, or calling APIs.

Bellwether is a CLI tool for **behavioral drift detection** in MCP servers. It **interviews** your server from 4 different personas, catches regressions before deployment, and generates AGENTS.md documentation as a byproduct:

1. **Discovering** available tools, prompts, and resources
2. **Testing from 4 personas** - Technical writer, security tester, QA engineer, novice user
3. **Detecting behavioral drift** between baseline and current behavior
4. **Generating documentation** - AGENTS.md reflects what your server actually does

## Why Bellwether?

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Breaking changes slip into production unnoticed | **Behavioral drift detection** - Compare baselines to catch regressions before deployment |
| Manual testing misses edge cases | **4-persona testing** - The only tool that tests from technical writer, security tester, QA engineer, and novice user perspectives |
| Security vulnerabilities are hard to discover | **Security persona** - Dedicated adversarial testing catches path traversal, injection, and info disclosure |
| Documentation gets stale | **Free documentation** - AGENTS.md is generated automatically from test results |

## What Makes Bellwether Different

| Feature | Bellwether | Other MCP Tools |
|:--------|:-----------|:----------------|
| **Behavioral drift detection** | ✅ Semantic comparison | ❌ Schema-only or none |
| **Multi-persona testing** | ✅ 4 unique perspectives | ❌ Single perspective |
| **Documentation generation** | ✅ AGENTS.md included | ❌ Not available |
| **CI/CD integration** | ✅ GitHub Action | ⚠️ Limited |

## Key Features

- **Behavioral Drift Detection** - Compare baselines to catch regressions before deployment (not just schema changes)
- **4-Persona Testing** - Technical writer, security tester, QA engineer, novice user—the only MCP tool with multi-perspective testing
- **Free Documentation** - AGENTS.md generated automatically from test results
- **CI/CD Integration** - GitHub Action for automated regression testing in your pipeline
- **Security Hygiene** - Dedicated security persona catches common vulnerabilities
- **Complete MCP Coverage** - Test tools, prompts, and resources with content previews and access patterns
- **MCP Registry Integration** - Search and discover servers from the official MCP Registry
- **Verification Badges** - Earn Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum coverage badges for your server

```

## Output Example

Bellwether generates `AGENTS.md` files documenting observed server behavior:

```markdown
# @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem

> Generated by Bellwether on 2026-01-12

## Overview

A file management server providing tools for reading, writing, and searching files.

## Tools

### read_file

Read contents of a file from the specified path.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| path | string | yes | Path to the file to read |

**Observed Behavior:**
- Returns file contents as UTF-8 text
- Binary files are returned as base64-encoded content
- Maximum file size: 10MB

**Limitations:**
- Cannot read files outside configured root directory

**Security Considerations:**
- Path traversal attempts (../) are normalized within root
```

## Cost Efficiency

Bellwether uses LLMs for intelligent testing. Typical costs per interview (10 tools, 3 questions each):

| Model | Cost | Quality |
|:------|:-----|:--------|
| `gpt-5-mini` | ~$0.02 | Good (recommended for CI) |
| `claude-haiku-4-5` | ~$0.04 | Good |
| `gpt-5.2` | ~$0.12 | Best |
| `claude-sonnet-4-5` | ~$0.13 | Best |
| Ollama (local) | Free | Variable |

Use `--quick` flag in CI for fastest, cheapest runs (~$0.01).

## Quick Example

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @dotsetlabs/bellwether

# Set your API key (interactive setup - stores in keychain)
bellwether auth
# Or: export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxx (or use Ollama for free)

# Interview a local server during development
bellwether interview node ./src/mcp-server.js

# Or interview an npm package
bellwether interview npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem /tmp

# Output: AGENTS.md with behavioral documentation
```

## Local Development Workflow

Bellwether integrates into your development workflow to catch behavioral drift before deployment:

```bash
# 1. Test your local server
bellwether interview node ./src/mcp-server.js

# 2. Save a baseline after initial development
bellwether interview --save-baseline node ./src/mcp-server.js

# 3. Use watch mode for continuous testing
bellwether watch node ./src/mcp-server.js --watch-path ./src

# 4. Before committing, check for drift
bellwether interview --compare-baseline ./baseline.json node ./src/mcp-server.js
```

Use Ollama for completely free testing during development.
